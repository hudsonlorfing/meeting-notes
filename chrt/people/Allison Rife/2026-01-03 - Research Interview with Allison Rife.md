## Meeting Details
| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-01-03 |
| **Attendees** | Hudson Lorfing, Allison Rife |
| **Duration** | ? min |

## Participant Profile
| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Allison Rife |
| **Title** | Medical Device Logistics Manager |
| **Company** | [Not specified] |
| **Segment** | Shipper |
| **Industry** | Healthcare |

## Executive Summary
Allison is an 8-year veteran of medical device logistics specializing in surgical kit management. Her primary challenge is lack of visibility into time-critical deliveries, forcing her team to make multiple phone calls to couriers when surgeons are waiting for kits. She needs real-time GPS tracking and proactive alerts to eliminate manual status checking and ensure surgical procedures aren't delayed.

## Current State
**Tech Stack:** [Not specified - likely traditional phone-based communication]
**Operations:** Manual courier status checking via phone calls for surgical kit deliveries
**Vendors:** Multiple couriers (specifics not mentioned)

## Pain Points

### Pain 1: Lack of Delivery Visibility
- **Description:** No real-time visibility into surgical kit deliveries, requiring multiple phone calls to couriers
- **Quote:** "When we have a surgeon waiting for a kit, we are often calling the courier multiple times just to get an update"
- **Severity:** 🔴 High
- **Impact:** Delayed surgeries, wasted staff time, surgeon frustration

### Pain 2: Reactive Communication Model
- **Description:** Must proactively call for updates rather than receiving proactive alerts
- **Quote:** "Visibility is our number one issue"
- **Severity:** 🔴 High
- **Impact:** Inefficient operations, constant interruptions, stress during critical deliveries

## Key Quotes

**On Current Pain:**
> "Honestly, visibility is our number one issue. When we have a surgeon waiting for a kit, we are often calling the courier multiple times just to get an update." — Allison Rife, Medical Device Logistics Manager

**On Ideal Solution:**
> "Real-time GPS tracking would be huge. And proactive alerts." — Allison Rife, Medical Device Logistics Manager

## Buying Signals
- Uses language like "number one issue" indicating high priority problem
- Specific solution requirements mentioned (GPS tracking, proactive alerts)
- High-stakes use case (surgeons waiting) suggests budget availability

## Warning Signs
- Limited interview depth - need more details on decision-making process
- No mention of budget, timeline, or other stakeholders

## Segment Insights
**Shippers:** Classic shipper pain point around lack of visibility into critical shipments. Medical device companies are high-value Chrt prospects due to time-critical nature and willingness to pay for reliability.

**Forwarders:** Not applicable to this participant.

**Couriers:** The couriers Allison works with likely lack modern tracking capabilities, representing potential courier segment opportunities.

## Product Implications
| Feature | Need | Priority | Evidence |
|---------|------|----------|----------|
| Real-time GPS tracking | Live location visibility | High | "Real-time GPS tracking would be huge" |
| Proactive alerts | Automated status updates | High | "And proactive alerts" |
| Shipper dashboard | Centralized visibility | High | Multiple courier calls indicates need for unified view |
