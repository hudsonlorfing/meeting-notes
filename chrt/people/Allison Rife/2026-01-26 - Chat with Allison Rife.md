# Chat with Allison Rife

> Casual catch-up call that evolved into strategic discussion about branding and marketing for Hudson's logistics startup Chart

## Meeting Details
| | |
|---|---|
| **Date** | 2026-01-26 |
| **Attendees** | Hudson Lorfing, Allison Rife |
| **Duration** | 1 min |

## Summary
Started as a personal catch-up but became a valuable consultation on Chart's branding and go-to-market strategy. Allison provided expert insights on when to hire agencies vs. in-house marketing talent, brand development process, and visual identity needs. Discussion covered Chart's current stage (black text on white background), growth trajectory goals, and the relational nature of logistics industry.

## Key Points
- Chart lacks brand identity - currently "black text on white page" with no visual brand guidelines
- Company building full-stack logistics platform (courier OS, driver app, shipper portal, coordinator tools)
- Hudson's role focuses on revenue generation across lead gen, sales, and retention
- Logistics industry is highly relational - word of mouth is crucial for growth
- Brand's primary role at this stage: legitimacy and clear articulation of services
- Recommendation to start with visual identity/brand book from Y Combinator network agencies
- Hiring timeline: bring in go-to-market person (ex-McKinsey candidate) around July

## Action Items
- [ ] Research Y Combinator network for branding agencies specializing in startups #hudson
- [ ] Consider Brandon Giello (Fort Worth) for comprehensive brand strategy and visual identity #hudson
- [ ] Evaluate timing for hiring go-to-market person based on current lead pipeline #hudson
- [ ] Focus on converting existing waitlist (670+ couriers) before major brand investment #hudson

## Decisions
- Start with branding agency for visual identity and brand book rather than hiring in-house immediately
- Prioritize business-minded marketing hire over creative/artistic background
- Target specific geographic markets (LA/San Diego) for initial testing and validation

## Follow-up
- Meet for late lunch tomorrow when Jonathan arrives at Love Field (1:30pm)
- Continue evaluating brand development timeline based on customer onboarding progress
- Assess when current demand pipeline requires dedicated marketing support

## Notes
**Personal Updates:**
- Jonathan visiting tomorrow, driving to lake house afterward
- Family Christmas with 5 people, awaiting Garrett's baby
- Hudson won pickleball tournament, helped Tyler improve record to 1-12

**Business Context:**
- Chart accepted to Y Combinator, experiencing rapid product expansion beyond original scope
- Strong organic growth through YouTube mention and industry word-of-mouth
- Targeting aggressive growth: $1M year 1, $10M year 2, $300M year 3
- Flexport cited as successful Y Combinator logistics company benchmark
